# Unit Annotation Results for ImageNet-AlexNet and Places205-AlexNet.

We annotate the unit segmentations (top ranked image segmentation for each unit at http://places.csail.mit.edu/visualization/segmentation/) for all the five convolutional layers in ImageNet-AlexNet and Places205-AlexNet in the ICLR'15 paper Object Detectors emerge from deep scene CNNs.

In each unit, we annotate three times. At each time the AMT worker gives the description for each unit, its category (simple elements, to scene, 1 of 6 categories), and the top-60 precision as a detector for that description.

We also release the annotation interface as ```interface.html```.

If you find the annotation useful, please cite our ICLR'15 paper:
